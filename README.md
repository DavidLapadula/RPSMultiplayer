UofT Bootcamp - Week 7 Assignment

# Description
Online multiplayer rock paper scissors game. 

## Technology Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Jquery
* Firebase DBAAS used for data persistence and multiplayer capabilities

##Resolutions
On difficulty I had when first starting this program was getting the browser to display specific information for each specific player. To solve this I created an 'active player' value that was populated when the user chooses their charatcer's name. I then used this value to determine what to show on the browser, allowing for personalized data on the screen. 
 
## Instructions
* Start as Player 1 and wait for another player, or if Player 1 exists, then start as Player 2 and begin right away 
* Play rock paper scissors while the game counts your wins, losses, and ties. 
* Send messages your opponenet during the game with the personalzed message board
* If your opponent leaves, you can remain in the game and wait for another player to join 
* If you load the page when Player 1 and 2 are active then just wait and refresh the page. Once one leaves the 'join' screen will show
